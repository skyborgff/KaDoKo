        <div class="card-body anime-description">
          Several hundred years ago, humans were nearly exterminated by titans. Titans are typically several stories tall,
          seem to have no intelligence, devour human beings and, worst of all, seem to do it for the pleasure rather than
          as a food source. A small percentage of humanity survived by walling themselves in a city protected by extremely
          high walls, even taller than the biggest of titans.

          Flash forward to the present and the city has not seen a titan in over 100 years. Teenage boy Eren and his foster
          sister Mikasa witness something horrific as the city walls are destroyed by a super titan that appears out of
          thin air. As the smaller titans flood the city, the two kids watch in horror as their mother is eaten alive. Eren
          vows that he will murder every single titan and take revenge for all of mankind.

          Note: The last episode received a pre-airing in Tokyo, Marunouchi Piccadilly 1 theater. TV broadcast took place after midnight, a few hours later.

          Naruto closely follows the life of a boy who is feared and detested by the villagers of the hidden leaf
          village of Konoha. The distrust of the boy has little to do with the boy himself, but it's what's inside him
          that causes anxiety. Long before Naruto came to be, a Kyuubi (demon fox) with great fury and power waged war
          taking many lives. The battle ensued for a long time until a man known as the Fourth Hokage, Yondaime, the
          strongest ninja in Konoha, fiercely fought the Kyuubi. The fight was soon won by Yondaime as he sealed the
          evil demon in a human body. Thus the boy, Naruto, was born. As Naruto grows he decides to become the
          strongest ninja in Konoha in an effort to show everyone that he is not as they perceive him to be, but is a
          human being worthy of love and admiration. But the road to becoming Hokage, the title for the strongest ninja
          in Konoha, is a long and arduous one. It is a path filled with betrayal, pain, and loss; but with hard work,
          Naruto may achieve Hokage.

          Note: Starting from 29.04.2009 a rerun of Naruto began airing in HD with the changed title Naruto: Shounen
          Hen (ナルト 少年篇) featuring new openings, endings and 2D/3D effects. It included new scenes and most of
          non-canon material was cut to make it more faithful to the original manga.
